# **Code Sample - Copernicus Seasonal Forecast Module** 

This repository contains the **core implementation script** of the **seasonal forecast module** of [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/), developed as part of the [U-CLIMADAPT project](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/user-uptake/details/responding-to-the-impact-of-climate-change-u-climadapt-488). The module facilitates the management of **seasonal forecast data** from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu), particularly the [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview).

I think this code is a strong example of my recent work. It presents the core class `SeasonalForecast`, which manages the entire data pipeline â€” from downloading, processing, and analyzing seasonal forecast data to computing climate indices (e.g., Heatwave Days, Tropical Nights) and generating CLIMADA-compatible `Hazard` objects for impact modeling. The module is designed for seamless integration with the CLIMADA Petals extension and supports impact-based forecasting.

Note: This seasonal forecast module is currently under development and not yet part of the official CLIMADA Petals release. It is scheduled for integration in the mid 2025 CLIMADA release.
