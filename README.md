# **Copernicus Seasonal Forecast Module** 

<img src="images/repo_qr.png" alt="Repository QR Code" width="150"/>


This repository contains the core **single Python script** of the new **seasonal forecast module** of [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/), developed as part of the [U-CLIMADAPT project](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/user-uptake/details/responding-to-the-impact-of-climate-change-u-climadapt-488). The module facilitates the management of **seasonal forecast data** from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu), particularly the [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview).

This implementation provides a modular pipeline for downloading, processing, and analyzing seasonal forecast data, computing climate indices (e.g., Heatwave Days, Tropical Nights), and generating CLIMADA-compatible `Hazard` objects for impact modeling. It is designed for seamless integration with the CLIMADA Petals extension and supports impact-base forescasting.

The core class `SeasonalForecast` manages the entire data pipeline â€” from raw data download to hazard creation â€” and includes utilities for file checking, plotting forecast skill metrics, and structured output path generation according to CLIMADA conventions.

Note: This seasonal forecast module is currently under development and not yet part of the official CLIMADA Petals release. It is scheduled for integration in the mid 2025 CLIMADA release.
